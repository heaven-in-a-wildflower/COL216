# COL216 - Computer Architecture
- This contains the assignmnets undertaken as part of the course as taught by Professor Kolin Paul in 2024's spring semester.
- For theory which does not involve RISC-V, I strongly recommend reading the 3rd edition of Henley and Patterson which I have uploaded here as it contains topics which were removed in subsequent editions.
- For developing interest in the subject, I strongly recommend Professor Onur Mutlu's lectures - (https://youtu.be/zLP_X4wyHbY?si=sCGSjb9HuEgrl9NN)
